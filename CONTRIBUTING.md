# Contributing to Move-UserFolders

üéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This project aims to help Windows users move their default user folders (Documents, Downloads, etc.) from `C:` to another drive (`D:`) easily via PowerShell. Any help to make it more robust, flexible, or user-friendly is appreciated!
